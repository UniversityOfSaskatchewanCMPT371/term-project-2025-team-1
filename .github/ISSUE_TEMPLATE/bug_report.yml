          Please provide sample files for a minimal reproduction case, if the issue can't be
          reproduced without it or it is helpful to demonstrate the issue.


          Preferably files should be attached directly within the text field below. Due to GitHub's
          upload restriction, you may need to archive the sample file first and upload it as `.zip`
          file. If the sample file is too big to attach directly, use a solution that is easy to
          access with possible long-term retention. Possible services include, but are not limited
          to, the following:

           - [0x0.st](https://0x0.st/) (no long-term retention)
           - [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com)
           - [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/)
